# Doctor-Patient-Appointment-Database
This project is a case-based SQL assignment designed to simulate a real-world Doctor-Patient Appointment Management System. It involves designing a relational database, inserting sample data, and writing complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data.

📂 Project Includes:
Database schema creation (6 tables)

Sample data for each table (10 records per table)

10 real-world SQL query solutions for business insights

📊 Tables Used:
Doctors – Doctor profiles and specializations

Patients – Patient details

Appointments – Records of all scheduled/completed/cancelled appointments

Departments – Hospital departments (e.g., Cardiology, Neurology)

Specialties – Doctor specializations

Payments – Payment records related to appointments

🧠 SQL Concepts Practiced:
JOINs (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)

Aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG)

Filtering (WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING)

Sorting and Ranking

Subqueries and LIMIT

✅ Example Queries:
Total appointments per doctor

Patients with appointments to a specific doctor

Most popular specialty

Average payment for completed appointments

Doctor with the most appointments
